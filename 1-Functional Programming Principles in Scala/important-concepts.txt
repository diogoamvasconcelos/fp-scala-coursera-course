-> Tail Recursion

-> List (immutable)

-> Pattern matching

-> List Functions
    . basic: head, tail, isEmpty
    . first order (all made using head, tail, isEmpty): last, reverse, indexOf, ....
    . higher order: map, filter, reduce/fold

        - use map, filter, reduce for EVERYTHING!!! (very powerfull)

-> Synthax tricks/sugar
    ((x, y) => x + y)   -> (_ + _)

-> Sequence Collections
    . vector, range, etc..
    . its operations (the whole list, map, flatMap, head, filter, exists, takeWhile, zip, etc...)


-> Combinatorial Search
    . nested loops data expressed as using ranges, map and flatten, flatMap
    . filter on the data with filer

    -> Or use For-Expressions (same implementation as above, but abstraced with simple Synthax)
        for (p <- persons if p.age > 20) yield p.names
            this is equivalent to:
        persons filter (p => p.age > 20) map (p => p.name)   

-> Maps
    Map Default Values (very nice)

-> Variable number of arguments -> arguments Sequence -> (*)

-> Scala's Immutable collections are very attractive for Software Development because:
    easy to use: easy to combine functions to create very powerful high order functions 
    consice: one word replaces a whole loops
    safe: type checker is good for static analysis (catch error in compilation and not at run time)
    fast: collection operations are tuned/optimized in the std::scala::lib and can be parallelized
    universal: one API/vocabulary to work on all kinds of collections
