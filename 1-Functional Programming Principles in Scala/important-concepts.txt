-> Tail Recursion

-> List (immutable)

-> Pattern matching

-> List Functions
    . basic: head, tail, isEmpty
    . first order (all made using head, tail, isEmpty): last, reverse, indexOf, ....
    . higher order: map, filter, reduce/fold

        - use map, filter, reduce for EVERYTHING!!! (very powerfull)

-> Synthax tricks/sugar
    ((x, y) => x + y)   -> (_ + _)

-> Sequence Collections
    . vector, range, etc..
    . its operations (the whole list, map, flatMap, head, filter, exists, takeWhile, zip, etc...)
