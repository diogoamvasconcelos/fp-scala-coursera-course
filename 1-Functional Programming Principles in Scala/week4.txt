--- Types and Pattern Matching ---

    -- Pure Object Orientation --
        . every value is an Object (of a type Class)
            . scala is a POO!! (event the primitive types are objects!) 
            . primitive types are objects....functions are objects
                . Compiler will replace by Java primitives, but this is an optmization

    
    -- Functions as Objects --
        . function values are treated as Objects in Scala

            function type A => B is an abbreviation for the class scala.Function1[A, B], which is defined as:
                trait Function1[A, B] {
                    def apply
                }
