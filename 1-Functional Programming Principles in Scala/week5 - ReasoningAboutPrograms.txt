claim: FP is more managable to reason about programs  -> Easy to prove mathematical Equational Proofs!!

- How to verify/prove if Concat respects the following rules:
    . is associative
    . that is admits the Nil as neutral element to the left and to the right

    -- Structural Induction --
        . proof principle

        . reminder about "natural induction" (for natural numbers, where n >= b)
            i. Show base case P(b) (propery of 'b')
            ii. for al integers n >= b show the induction step
                if P(n) then P(n+1) i also hold true

                e.g: 
                    factorial(n) >= 2^n

                    . base case, b = 4:    factorial(4) >= 2^4   ---> 24 >= 16 (true)
                    . induction step, n+1: (n+1) * factorial(n)  ->   2 * factorial(n) 
                        so then: 2 * factorial(n) => 2 * 2^n
                          e.g: if factorial(4) => 2^4   then 2 * factorial(4) => 2 * 2^4   hold true!!

              . We can use these equalities (lhs >= rhs) because Pure Functional Programs dont have side effects, so reducing those 2 terms is "clean" and the same as rewritting them

        - Structural Induction Method -
            . similar to natural induction
            . prove a propery P(xs) for all lists xs

                i. show that P(Nil) holds   <-  base case
                ii. for a list xs and som element x, show the induction step
                    if P(xs) holds then P(x::xs) also holds


                e.g: associativeness of concat
                    (xs ++ ys) ++ zs = xs ++ (ys ++ zs)

                    .imple of concat:    def concat(xs:List, ys:List):List = xs match
                                            case Nil => ys
                                            case x :: xs1 => x :: concat(xs1, ys)

                    .clauses derived from the implementation
                        Nill ++ ys = ys         //1st clause
                        (x :: xs1) ++ ys = x :: (xs1 ++ ys)  //2nd clause


                    .base case: Nil
                        lhs: (Nil ++ ys) ++ zs
                            = ys ++ zs  // can be simplified by this using the 1st clause, Nill ++ ys = ys

                        rhs: Nil ++ (ys ++ zs)
                            = ys ++ zs  // same

                            -> proven, holds

                    .indiction step: x :: xs
                        lhs ((x :: xs) ++ ys) ++ zs
                            = (x :: (xs ++ ys)) ++ zs   //simplified by the 2nd clause
                            = x :: ((xs ++ ys)) ++ zs)   //simplified by the 2nd clause again
                            = x :: (xs ++ (ys ++ zs))   //by invoking the induction hypothesis of associativeness itself: (xs ++ ys) ++ zs = xs ++ (ys ++ zs)

                        rhs (x :: xs) ++ (ys ++ zs)
                            = x :: (xs ++ (ys ++ zs))   //simplified by the 2nd clause, and is already the induction hypothesis of associativeness and has the same value as lhs


                            -> HOLDS!!

                     e.g2: xs ++ Nil = xs
                            base case: Nil ++ Nil = Nil
                                        = Nil  //1st cause

                            induction step: (x :: xs) ++ Nil = (x :: xs)
                                            = x :: (xs ++ Nil) = x :: xs //simplified using 2nd clause
                                            =  x :: xs = x :: xs //simplified using base case
