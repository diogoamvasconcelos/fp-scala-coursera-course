--- Lists ---
    . continuation of Lists

     -List Methods -
        . xs.head
        . xs.tail       , all except head
        . xs.isEmpty
        . xs.length
        . xs.last       , last element, exception if empty
        . xs.init       , list of all elements except the last one (exception if empty)
        . xs take n     , list of first 'n' elements of xs (or xs itself if length < n)
        . xs drop n     , list of remainder elements after taking 'n' elements
        . xs(n)         , (or xs apply n) the element of xs at index 'n'
        . xs splitAt n : (fsn, snd) , return pair of 2 lists, first-hand-side and second-hand-side split at the 'n' element

        - create list:
        . xs ++ ys      , list of all elements of xs followed by all elements of ys  (concat, :::)
        . x :: xs       , concanate x elemtn to xs (as its new head)
        . xs ::: x     , add x to xs at the end (as its new tail) (same concat)
        . xs.reverse    , elements of xs in reversed order
        . xs update (n, x) , list containg the same elements as xs, except at index 'n' where it now contains the new element 'x'

        - finding elements:
        . xs indexOf x  , the index of the first element in xs equal to x (or -1 if not found)
        . xs contains x , same as xs indexOf x >= 0


    . Implementation of these methods:
        head -> contant time (O(1)), very simple lookup
        :: -> O(1) as well
        
        last -> def last(xs: List) = xs match 
                    case List() => throw error (empty list)
                    case List(x) => xs   (single element)
                    case y :: ys => last(ys)  (2+ element list)

                . O(n) linear complexity

        init -> def init(xs: List) = xs match
                    case List() => throw error
                    case List(x) => List() 
                    case y :: ys => y :: init(ys)

                . O(n) complexity (analogous to 'last')

        concat(xs: List, ys: List): List = xs match
                case List() => ys
                case z :: zs => z :: concat(zs, ys)

                . O(n) complexity (n = size of xs)

        reverse(xs: List): List = xs match
            case List() => xs
            case y :: ys => reverse(ys) ::: y

            . O(n^2) complexity,   because ::: is O(n) itself
                . can it be improved?? (yes!!)
                . using foldLeft it can be O(n)!!


    . Combining the methods to create other methods:
        def removeAt(n: Int, xs: List): List = (xs take n) ::: (xs drop n+1)


--- Pais and Tuples ---

    val pair = ("answer", 42)    results in pair: (String, Int) = (answer, 42)

    . pairs can be used as patterns:
        e.g: val (label, value) = pair      results: label: String = answer and value: Int = 42

    . Works for tuples with more than 2 elements as well!!!  (pair is a tuple of 2 elements)

    . access fields with ._1, ._2, etc....

    . example task: Merge Sort!
        def msort(xs: List): List = 
        {
            val n = xs.length / 2
            if (n == 0) xs
            else
            {
                def merge(xs:List, ys:List) = ???

                val (fsd, snd) = xs splitAt n
                merge(msort(fds, msort(snd)))
            }
        }

            possible implentation of merge
                def merge (xs: List, ys: List): List = xs match
                {
                    case Nil => ys
                    case x :: xs1 => ys match
                    {
                        case Nil => xs
                        case y :: ys1 => 
                            if (x < y) x :: merge(xs1, ys)
                            else y :: merge(xs, ys1)
                    }
                }

            better implemention without the nested pattern matching (use pattern matching over pairs)
                def merge (xs: List, ys: List): List = (xs, ys) match
                {
                    case (Nil, Nil) => Nil
                    case (Nil, ys) => ys
                    case (xs, Nil) => xs
                    case (x :: xs1, y :: ys1) => 
                        if (x < y) x :: merge(xs1, ys)
                        else y :: merge(xs, ys1)
                }


            
-- Implicit Argument Parameterization --
    . parameterize "merge" to use other data types then Int
        . pass a "compare function" as an argument

            def msort[T](xs: List[T])(lt: (T, T) => Boolean): List[T] = ... if (lt(x, y)) ,,,
            msort(nums)((x: Int, y: Int) => x < y)

        . or use the already defined class in the standard lib for ordering:
            scala.math.Ordering[T]

            def msort[T](xs: List[T])(ord: Ordering): List[T] = ... if (ord.lt(x, t)) ...
            msort(nums)(Ordering.Int)

    . Would be nicer to be avoid passing the compare function in the first place....
        ->> make "ord" and implicit parameter  (like default value in C++)

            def msort[T](xs: List[T])(implicit ord: Ordering): List[T] = ... if (ord.lt(x, t)) ...  <- Compiler will figure out the correct type of Ordering for T
            msort(nums)

        . Compiler will figure out the right implicit to pass based on the demanded type T

            - Rules of Implicit Parameters -
                if a function takes an implicit parameter of type T
                , the compiler will seach an implicit definition that:

                i. is marked implicit
                ii. has type compatible with T
                iii. is visible to the point of the function call or is defined in a companion object associated with T

                - If there is a single (most specific) definition, that will be used, otherwise ERROR

        
-- Higher Order List Functions --
    . Work on lists and take another Function as arguments
        e.g: using generic functions to implement the following patterns:
            
            
            ->> Map: transform each element in a list in a certain way
                def map[U](f: T => U): List[U] = this match
                {
                    case Nil => this
                    case x :: xs => f(x) :: xs.map(f)
                }

                def scaleList(xs: List[Double], factor: Double) = xs map(x => x * factor)
            
            ->> Filtering: retieve a list of all elements that satisfy a certain criterion
                def filter[T](p: T => Boolean): List[T] = this match
                {
                    case Nil => this
                    case x :: xs => if (p(x)) x :: xs.filter(f) else xs.filter(f)
                }

                def posElems(xsL List[Int]): List[Int] = xs filter(x => x < 0)

                other similar methods:
                    - xs filterNot p        , inverse of filter, if (!p(x)) ....
                    - xs partition p        , same as (xs filter p, xs filterNot p), but computed in a single traversal of the list xs
                    - xs takeWhile p        , the longest prefix of xs consisting of elements that all satisfy the predicate pair
                        e.g: List(2, -1, 3)  list takeWhile (x => x > 0)   returns List(2)   (collects the longest PREFIX untill element with P is found!!)
                    - xs dropWhile p        , the remainder of the list xs after any leading element satisfying p have been removed. Oposite of takeWhile
                    - xs span p             , same as (xs takeWhile p, xs dropWhile p), but single traversal algorithm
            
            
            ->> Reduce (Fold) : Combine the elements of a list using a given operator (like sum of all elements)

                List(x1, ..., xs) reduceLeft op    (make sure to start the list with its unit value)

                def reduceLeft[T](op: (T, T) => T): T = this match
                {
                    case Nil => throw new Error("Nil.reduceLeft")
                    case x :: xs => (xs foldLeft x)(op)
                }

                def sum(xs: List[Int]) = (0 :: xs) reduceLeft ((x, y) => x + y)
                def prod(xs: List[Int]) = (1 :: xs) reduceLeft ((x, y) => x * y)


                NOTE: instead of ((x, y) => x + y)  , you can use just (_ + _) (synthax sugar!!!)
                    . each '_' represents a new parameter, from left to right

                . reduceLeft -> can only be applied to non-empty lists
                    . the more general version is : foldLeft


                - foldLeft -> similar to reduceLeft but takes an extra argument, the "initial value (zero element - z) "
                    def foldLeft[T](z: U)(op: (U, T) => U): U = this match
                    {
                        case Nil => z
                        case x :: xs => (xs foldLeft op(z, x))(op)  //a bit more complicated...
                    }

                    def sum(xs: List[Int]) = (xs foldLeft 0) (_ + _)
                    def prod(xs: List[Int]) = (xs foldLeft 1) (_ * _)

                - the "right side" versions: reduceRight and foldRight are very similar but accumulate from the tail to the head (right to the left)

                    def reduceRight[T](op: (T, T) => T): T = this match
                    {
                        case Nil => throw new Error("Nil.reduceRight")
                        case x :: xs => op(x, xs.reduceRight(op))
                    }

                    def foldRight[T](z: U)(op: (U, T) => U): U = this match
                    {
                        case Nil => z
                        case x :: xs => op(x, (xs foldRight z)(op))
                    }
                
                Note: if the operator is associative and commuatative, (+, *) foldLeft and foldRight are equivalent (but might be differnt in effeciency)!
                    e.g:
                        def concat[T](xs: List[T], ys: List[T]): List[T] = 
                            (xs foldRight ys) (_ :: _)

                        -this dont work if we use foldLeft!
                            . types wouldnt work out (see lecture for explanation...., basically we try to apply a :: b where b is not a list)


                    ->> Diff right to left  https://commitlogs.com/2016/09/10/scala-fold-foldleft-and-foldright/
                        def len(list: List): Int = list foldLeft(0) ((count, _) => count + 1)  // accumulator is on the left. apply function to next element and add to preceding result

                        def len(list: List): Int = list foldRight(0) ((_, count) => count + 1)   // accumulator is on the right. apply function to prev element and add to succeding result (start from end)
