        desing method translate(phoneNumber) that produces all phrases of words that can serve as mnemocis for the phone number

--- COURSE-CONCLUSION ---
 
    Traits of Scala and FP:
        - highe-order cunctions
        - case classes and pattern matching
        - immmutable collections
        - absence of mutable state
        - flexible evaluation strategies: strict vs by name

    . useful toolkit for every programmer
    . different way of thinking about programs
