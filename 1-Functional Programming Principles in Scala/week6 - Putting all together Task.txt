--- Putting all the week 5 and 6 information about collections in use to solve a bigger task ---

    -- Task --
        phone keys have mnemocis assigned to them: 2 -> "ABC", etc
        desing method translate(phoneNumber) that produces all phrases of words that can serve as mnemocis for the phone number

            e.g: "7225247386" -> "scala is fun" as one element of the solutions set

--- COURSE-CONCLUSION ---
 
    Traits of Scala and FP:
        - higher-order functions
        - case classes and pattern matching
        - immmutable collections
        - absence of mutable state
        - flexible evaluation strategies: strict vs by name

    . useful toolkit for every programmer
    . different way of thinking about programs
